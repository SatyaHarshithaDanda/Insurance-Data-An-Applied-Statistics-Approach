# Insurance Data: An Applied Statistics Approach

This project demonstrates the application of statistical analysis and visualization techniques on an insurance dataset. The goal is to extract actionable insights using descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, hypothesis testing, and regression models.

## 📊 Project Overview

Insurance companies rely heavily on data to make informed decisions about risk assessment, pricing, and customer segmentation. This notebook provides a comprehensive statistical exploration of such data using Python, aiming to:

- Understand the distribution and relationship of features such as age, BMI, charges, etc.
- Identify correlations and patterns among variables.
- Apply statistical techniques to test hypotheses and derive business insights.
- Build and interpret linear regression models for predicting insurance charges.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset typically includes the following features:

- `age`: Age of the primary beneficiary
- `sex`: Gender of the beneficiary
- `bmi`: Body mass index, providing an indication of body fat
- `children`: Number of dependents
- `smoker`: Smoking status
- `region`: Residential area in the US
- `charges`: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance

> Note: The dataset used in this analysis is commonly available as `insurance.csv`.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)
- SciPy & StatsModels (for statistical analysis)
- Scikit-learn (for regression modeling)

## 📈 Key Analyses

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Distribution plots, boxplots, heatmaps
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identifying strong predictors of insurance charges
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Understanding statistical significance between groups (e.g., smokers vs. non-smokers)
- **Regression Modeling**: Building a linear regression model to predict insurance charges

## 🔍 Insights & Conclusions

- Smoking status and BMI have a significant impact on insurance charges.
- Statistical tests confirm that smokers are charged substantially higher premiums.
- A linear regression model with relevant predictors gives a good estimation of charges.
